# Greenthereum (WIP)

Free and **Open Source** [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) tracker and account explorer app, built with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for **Android - iOS**.   

In a nutshell this app will give you access to follow and track your ethereums accounts activities and info in different currencies.  
**Important**: We will **never** ask for your **private** key, we don't need it, we only access the open information in the blockchain with your **public address**.
